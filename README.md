## Description


How are you really feeling right now? In the rush of daily life, we often forget to pause. Pulse is your minimalist micro-journaling companion designed to make reflection as effortless as possible.

No long entries, no pressure. Just you, a brief thought, and your current level on a scale from -2 to 2.

## Why Pulse?

* **Micro-Journaling:** Record what’s happening in the moment – in seconds.
* **Mood Tracking:** Log your well-being intuitively from -2 (low) to 2 (high).
* **Visual Frequency:** Track your emotional flow throughout the day with elegant, minimalist charts.
* **Focus on the Now:** A clean, distraction-free UI designed for peace of mind.
* **Full Privacy:** Data lives only on your phone (and iCloud, if used)

Understand the patterns of your life and find your balance. Your pulse, your day, your journal.
