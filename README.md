How are you really feeling right now? In the rush of daily life, we often forget to pause. Pulse is your minimalist micro-journaling companion designed to make reflection as effortless as possible.

No long entries, no pressure. Just you, a brief thought, and your current level on a scale from -2 to 2.

## Why Pulse?

* **Micro-Journaling:** Record what’s happening in the moment – in seconds.
